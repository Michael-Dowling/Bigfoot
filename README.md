This is a clone of a repository used in a class I took in Fundamentals of Software Development. It was developed as part of an agile
team, using agile tools such as Git, Jira, Confluence and Slack.

The app is aimed at making recycling easier - to determine how to properly dispose of their products, users simply scan their barcode 
and the app will tell users how to dispose of it. It contains all this functionality, however parts of the app are not fully fleshed out.
The course was primarily C++ based, which is why there are all the ugly and largely unneccesary JNI calls to use native C++ code.
