Cache's Git notes
(if they are wrong then blame Greg the thicc guy who sits by me in class)

git remote add origin and then url
id you dont want to push one file 
you would do git reset then the file name then git status again

need a git ignore

creating a new branch:
-git checkout -b 'name'
-git branch
-git push origin branch name
gotta delete the branch on the computer
-git checkout master
-git branch -D name
-git pull origin master

general git push:
-git add .
-git commit -m "Message"
-git push
you can use git status after git add . to check what is being added
